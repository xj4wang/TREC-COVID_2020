post-infection COVID-19 immunity
do individuals who recover from COVID-19 show sufficient immune response, including antibody levels and T-cell mediated immunity, to prevent re-infection?
There is concern about re-infection for COVID-19, so this topic is looking for studies suggesting post-infection immunity, including post-infection antibody levels (over time) and evidence for individuals who have been infected more than once.
