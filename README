For git, large files such as

CORD19:
metadata.csv
docids-rnd5.txt
topics-rnd5.xml
qrels-covid_d5_j0.5-5.txt

FEATURE-KIT:
concordance
svm.fil
df
tfdf

WORKINGFILES:
test_file_*
results_file_*
model_*

have been ignored.

These can be obtained through the CORD19 dataset, by runing feature kit by Gordon Cormack on the folder of unique files, or from running Sofia-ML.

This git shows state of the folders as they were at the end of our participation in TREC-COVID (with large files missing)
